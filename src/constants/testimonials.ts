      'I was honestly shocked at how Michael could pinpoint exactly what was off in my swing just from two videos. Grip, alignment, body movement he broke it all down in a way that clicked and gave me practical stuff to work on. Already noticing a difference. definitely worth it.'

      'Mike evaluated my swing with a couple clips and has already changed my game with a few tips. Changed my grip and now my elbow pain is gone, striking the ball much more consistently and naturally. Mike is a great coach for athletes for who want to stay athletes within the game of golf.'

      'Monte was able to break down my swing using the app within a couple days of sending a request. He uses real world analogies and feels to help bring out the inner athlete in his students. No fluff, limited thoughts with quality feels. really enjoyed the breakdown and call I had with him.'

      "Mike from Monte's golf turned my game around by teaching me how to get my core to initiate and deliver the arms, (pivoting & clearing my hips). The results also brought my game to shoot par scores vs the 8 handicap I had, along with the skills I learned on shot making and course management. Lots of hard work and dedication to get these results, it's up to you, how good you want to be. Monte's golf can and will get you the results you are looking for!"

      'It is my pleasure to recommend Mike Mangiaracina as the very reason I have been able to play competitive golf for the last 30 years he has taken a lot of time and effort to help me in my pursuit, and I have the highest regard for him as a teaching professional. P.S no one can hit a two iron off a concrete sidewalk without scratching the club! lol'

Mike's patient and insightful teaching style has helped me understand the fundamentals of cause and effect and develop a much more consistent swing. I've not only improved my skills, but i've also gained confidence and a deeper appreciation for the game. When a snag arises with my game, mike is my go to guy. One of the best in the business."

      'I have played this great game for 45 years and at 55 I still thankfully play to a 2 handicap. Through my years I have studied all the popular instructors, and like many of us have struggled to make sense of the contradictory teachings in magazines, tv and social media. For me it always comes back to my early lessons with Mike. He never taught me anything that seemed aligned with conventional golf schools and how they unsuccessfully try to teach students to “manufacture” the golf swing with inapplicable mechanical ideas like (straight left arm, wrist hinge or angle of attack etc) Mike instead had a brilliant way to simplify the the complex natural science of how the body works and how everyday motions like throwing a ball or skipping a stone were akin to the golf swing. His approach always simplifies everything for me, and when I catch myself over analyzing, I ground myself with his teachings about the natural balance and fluidity of the golf swing, which is no different than any other athletic motion. Thanks to Mike M. I have been able to simplify and enjoy this game for as many years as I have.'

      "Mike is so easy to work with. Stressed the fundamentals and kept things simple and easy to follow. What I also loved was that he would call me out when I didn’t practice what he instructed me to do . Like anything else you have to practice, it won’t just happen. I highly recommend Mike."

      'Mike taught me what I consider to be the three most valuable things in golf. First of all, he gave me a golf swing that works, according to the laws of physics and the most natural from an athletic standpoint. Secondly the ability to learn, cause and affect and be able to fix my swing when it goes awry. Thirdly, how to manage my golf game by always having the percentages on my side, which was fueled by having a go to shot that he gave me when I’m in those high pressure situations.'

      "Michael Mangiaracina is a highly skilled golf coach and professional with a rich heritage in the game. Taught by his father, sal monte, the legendary head professional at miami’s fontainebleau, Michael grew up immersed in golf's traditions. He was also mentored by Bill Mehlhorn, a 41-time tour winner renowned for his innovative teaching methods. Michael’s coaching philosophy is rooted in simplicity and accessibility. He emphasizes creating a repeatable swing motion that minimizes strain, particularly on the back, ensuring longevity and enjoyment for players of all levels. His approach is far from overly technical—he focuses on practical, intuitive techniques that allow golfers to warm up quickly without needing to hit countless balls on the range. With michael, you’ll not only improve your game but also develop a deeper understanding of golf in a way that feels natural and effortless."
