        In My Teachings, I won't be asking you to do anything that will require
        you to contort or stress your body in ways that only an Olympic gymnast
        could do. Nor will I ask you to move in an unnatural way that will lead
        you to needing a chiropractor. I won't be inventing any "new moves". I
        don't boast any new "discoveries" that you see come across YouTube, the
        golf channel or golf periodicals on the latest "move".
      </p>

      <p>
        I will tell you that if you apply the fundamentals I've learned, you can
        develop an effortless repeatable action that can shrink and expand for
        various size shots.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you grasp these basics, you can then focus on the most important
        parts of this great game, course management and playing percentage
        shots. This includes club selection, type of shot and choosing this
        wisely by examining simple factors.
      </p>

      <p>
        First let's understand a simple observation. Most of you ask, "Why do
        the pros look so effortless, hit it so far and make it look so easy?"
        Well, because it is. Their heads are not filled with crippling swing
        thoughts, nor is their body filled with the tension that is created when
        trying to manufacture positions and angles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's watch the great Jack Nicklaus, in the heat of battle. CLEARLY not
        thinking of mechanics. He is solely focused on choosing his weapon, his
        alignment, picturing the shot and reacting to that picture...

        Unfortunately most of you have began your golf journey under a couple of
        misconceptions and lesson tee clich√©s. Here are a few of them:
      </p>

      <div>
        <h2>Common things I hear in lessons</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep your left arm straight"</li>
          <li>Keep your head down</li>
          <li>Keep your head still</li>
          <li>One piece takeaway"</li>
          <li>Keep your left heel down (Right handed golfers)</li>
          <li>Set the angle"</li>
          <li>Take the club to 'PARALLEL"</li>
          <li>Pull the handle down</li>
          <li>Stack</li>
          <li>Extend your arms down the target line</li>
          <li>Turn the shoulders while restricting the hips (YIKES)</li>
          <li>It's all in the wrist action</li>
          <li>Hold the club firmly</li>
          <li>Strong grip</li>
          <li>Shallow</li>
          <li>Trail this, Trail that</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        These concepts and swing thoughts will cripple your ability to ever have
        a fluid, effortless repeating action. The game is to be played by feel
        and touch. This is impossible when one is mentally directing positions
        and movements that should and will take place when a few fundamentals
        are in place.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are still photos out there of all the greats that exhibit these
        illusions that start these rumors. Most of what they see with their eyes
        happened as "a result of", not mental direction. Even when an
        accomplished player describes the golf swing, they are describing a
        feeling, not what actually is going on.
      </p>

      <p>
        E.g: I assure you if you see a still photo of a champion's arms extended
        after impact, he did not command them to be so. They became that way as
        a result of outer centrifugal force, yes inward pull creating outward
        pull as a result of balance and resistance. This will be explained in
        more detail with video modules, But fabricating this particular popular
        idea is why most golfers struggle with blocks and slices, it prevents
        the natural release of the arms and they are forced to manufacture the
        "closing" of the club, and then they get the flip and hook. It's quite
        absurd.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also keep in mind, of the approximate 3,000 - 5,000 players out there
        that can play on a professional tour level, only about 200 breakthrough.
        Of those players, the winner each week on the most prestigious tours are
        the ones with the hottest putter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many of the names on the big circuits you never would of heard of if
        they weren't a superb putter. Yet many of the greatest ball strikers in
        the world who were only mediocre putters you really never hear of.
        What's my point? The point is <span>everyone</span> is always looking to
        imitate the action of the hottest players when that's truly not why they
        are winning. Not to mention, everyone has their own "body type" and
        their own tempo. Swing your swing that you develop from sound
        fundamentals and then chip and putt the crap out of the ball.
      </p>

          I will teach you an understanding of everything you need to become
          your best, delivered in simple words for you to understand and adapt
          to your game.
        </p>

        <p>
          I make it a point to not give any of my opinions, but stick to the
          laws of physics that apply to most all athletic actions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Most of you will benefit just from my videos, but some of you will need
        help <span>unlearning</span> some habits that you've already formed. It
        is said that it takes a world class athlete 6 weeks of hard work to make
        or break a habit. I find this to be true by experience, while some of
        you may instantly understand the cause of your error, and the cure, you
        must understand that under duress your body will resort to the most
        dominant habit, which will not be your new found <span>feel</span> that
        you <span>tasted</span> after our work.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's where the drills come in, sometimes exaggerations to break a
        habit, but they will transform the muscle memory fastest.
      </p>

      <p>
        I look forward to hearing from all of you and helping you with your
        game.
      </p>
