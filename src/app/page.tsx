        <p>
          I am Mike "Monte", your instructor. I will be meeting some of you in
          person and others by video.

        <p>
          You will learn the golf swing in it's simplest form, free of being
          conscious of mechanical mental direction that has you paralyzed and
          incapable of achieving an effortless fluid action. You will also learn
          the <strong>mindset</strong> that separates the winners from the rest
          of the field, which in your effort to become your best, the game of
          golf forces you to accomplish.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey from junior golf through my years as a competing
          professional under the guidance of the legendary "Wild" Bill Mehlhorn,
          and my father, Sal Monte, has taught me much over the past 50 years
          that I want to share with you.
